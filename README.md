# FreeCodeCamp - CodePortfolio
My coding portfolio from Free Code Camp.

##About
Contains all notable coding projects and algorithms from Free Code Camp.

##Notes
1. Each JavaScript (.js) file contains code to solve a given challenge. Free Code Camp encourages readers to write their own code and Read-Search-Ask when stuck. If you are stuck, read my javascript comments within the code and develop a solution from those. Do yourself a favor and solve the challenge yourself. You will thank yourself later.<br/><br/>
2. FreeCodeCamp modifies its challenges over time. The recent coding challenge may differ slightly from my code.
